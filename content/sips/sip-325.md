<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP introduces cross-chain functionality and several technical improvements to the existing [Election Module](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-207/) system. This will grant stakers the ability to vote in elections on any network where the Synthetix protocol is deployed.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This will deploy a new iteration of the existing `ElectionModule` with some proxy architecture improvements and cross-chain support via CCIP. It also establishes the concept of a "mothership deployment" (i.e. Optimism) in which the election results are tabulated and resolved.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Multi-chain is important. Need to iterate since the current election systems does not handle cross-chain messaging in a scalable way.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

TBD

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

- Why CCIP (no additional trust assumption, already using it)
- Why the mothership pattern
- Able to calculate v2 and v3 voting power because of progressive migration plan

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Epoch Periods

As in the current election system, there are four “periods” within each epoch:

- **Administration Period** - No election is under way.
- **Nomination Period** - Nearing the end of the epoch, addresses may be nominated for election.
- **Voting Period** - After the nomination period, addresses with voting power may assign votes to nominees.
- **Evaluation Period** - Finally, voting closes and the winners are calculated. The existing NFTs are burned and new NFTs are minted to the winners.

### Voting Power

- In the V2 system, voting power is based on the amount of debt shares an address has assumed.
- In the V3 system, voting power is based on the amount of SNX that an account has delegated to the Spartan Council pool.
- Voting power may be calculated as linear or quadratic.

### Cross-chain

- The elections system code has been designed such that the same codebase can be deployed to every chain. One deployment can be configured as the “mothership deployment”. This deployment receives information pertaining to all the votes via cross-chain messages and sends a cross-chain message back to each deployment during the Evaluation Period, such that NFTs are burned/minted appropriately on each chain.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

TBD

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

TBD
